# Developer memes
Okay, so who doesn't like memes?\
At least I do, and I wanted to make a fun project on the side of my studies. So here it is.

[Dev-memes](https://dev-memes.netlify.app/) is a wip, so don't judge :')

## How to get started:
### `npm install`
To install all of the node_modules that you'll need.

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
